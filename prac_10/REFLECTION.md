## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were often accurate, with little difference between my predictions and the actual time required. Tasks generally didn't take much longer than I expected.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy improved over time, and I became more efficient. I was able to complete my coursework within approximately 3 hours.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of detailed planning and allocating sufficient time for debugging and code reviews. This process also helped me improve my skills and become more efficient in managing tasks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed from other people, can teach you the proper syntax and indexing formats, which can be helpful in future practical tasks.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

There are many different ways to code programs, and by taking inspiration from different programs, it can be applied to your own work, and helps you learn without needing to watch tutorials or searching up websites.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

https://github.com/123yongzheng/CP1404-TR2/pull/2

### Explanation

I think for this code review, i was able to only give a simple fix to the code, which the feedback being to remove the "if__name" block, but to me it shows that eventhough a code may seem perfect at a glance there can be tiny nuances, that can still be improved.

### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/jcudingl/cp1404practicals_2024TR2/pull/4

### Explanation

This code review, was simple for me to comment, as I had to show that it wasnt necessary, to use a print(MENU) function, and it shows there can be many different styles of code, but its best to pick the style that shows the most simplistic format.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Nothing all the practical tasks, catered to my python learning needs.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think my ability to complete practicals, within a day or two.
