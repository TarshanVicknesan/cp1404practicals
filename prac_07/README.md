This repository contains my work for practical_7 for CP1404.

## About Me

Im a student keen on learning how to code properly, and gain some insight and discipline on proper code structure before working in an industry.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Using meaningful and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Code Readability:** Writing code that is easy to read by using proper indentation, spacing, and comments. This helps other developers (and your future self) understand the logic without much effort.
- **Modularity:** Breaking down the code into smaller, reusable functions or modules improves code organization and reduces redundancy.
